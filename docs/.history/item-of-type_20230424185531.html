    <h1>Using CSS to add content</h1>
    <p>
      The book showed a great trick using
      <code>td:nth-of-type(5):before { content: "Mac â€œ)</code>
      , which would put the word "Mac" in front of the 5th &lt;td&gt; in the
      table.
    </p>
    <p>Don't.</p>
    <p>
      It's super tempting. Let's say you want to label all your links to outside
      sites. You can use this handy code:
    </p>
    <p>
      <code>
        &lt;style&gt;
        <br />
        a.external:after {
        <br />
        content: " (external site) ";
        <br />
        }
        <br />
        &lt;/style&gt;
      </code>
    </p>

    <p>Do the link HTML like this:</p>
    <p>
      <code>&lt;a href="https://getbootstrap.com" class="external"&gt;</code>
    </p>
    <p>You'll get this:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p><a href="./positioning.html">Positioning</a></p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p><a href="./bootstrap/index.html">Bootstrap demos</a></p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          <a href="https://getbootstrap.com" class="external">Bootstrap HQ</a>
        </p>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>That is so awesome!</p>
    <p>So, what's the problem? It looks perfect!</p>
    <p>
      And that's the problem. It
      <em>looks</em>
      perfect. However, you have used CSS (which is for display) to add content.
      Accessibility software for blind people ignores CSS, because it's just
      display information that's worthless if you can't see.
    </p>
    <p>
      This means you have two different user experiences, and that sighted
      people are getting important information (you're leaving the safety of our
      site and getting sent out into the wilds of the Internet and we no longer
      control what you will see). That's actually an accessibility violation; disabled users need the same information as everyone else. The CSS has content in it, and they can't access that. It's not just a decoration.
    </p>
    <p>That really sucks, because I would very much like to be able to use this.</p>
